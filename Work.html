			<h2>Picture Book</h2>
			<p>I finish this book in Bootcamp. It's a stroy about a grandfather and his grandchild. The simple and short story does not use any emotional word but just objectively depict the interaction between those two main characters. I hope the readers are able to feel something after reading it.</p>
